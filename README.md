# web-based-password-generator
This GitHub repo hosts a web-based password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JS. It lets users create strong passwords with custom settings. The app dynamically updates the password based on length, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. It includes copy-to-clipboard functionality and handles edge.
Features and Components:

HTML Layout: The repository contains an HTML file named "index.html" that structures the user interface of the password generator application. It includes input fields for password length, checkboxes to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, a password display area, and a copy button.

CSS Styling: The "layout.css" file holds the CSS styles responsible for the visual appearance and layout of the application. It ensures a clean and organized design that is responsive across different devices.

JavaScript Logic: The "script.js" file contains the JavaScript code that drives the application's functionality. It interacts with the HTML elements, generates passwords, handles user selections, and enables copy-to-clipboard functionality.

Password Generation: The JavaScript code calculates character codes based on user preferences for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It then combines these codes to generate a randomized password of the desired length.

User Interaction: The code captures user interactions through checkboxes, input fields, and buttons. It responds to user selections by dynamically updating the displayed password and enabling the copy-to-clipboard feature.

Clipboard Copy: The application allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard with the click of a button. This feature enhances usability by simplifying the process of using the generated password in other applications or platforms.

Event Listeners: Event listeners are implemented to respond to user actions. For instance, clicking the copy button triggers the copy-to-clipboard functionality, and submitting the form initiates the password generation process.

Input Validation: The code accounts for edge cases, such as an empty password, and handles them gracefully. Users are provided with alerts and feedback to ensure a smooth experience.

Project Information: The "README.md" file can be included to provide essential information about the project, including a brief overview, usage instructions, and contributor information.
